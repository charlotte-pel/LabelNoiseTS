# SyntSITS-LabelNoise

SyntSITS-LabelNoise is a module for generating both correctly labelled data and data with labelling errors.

# Context: 

"To test the following hypothesis: "The presence of mislabelled data has a negative influence on the performance of classification algorithms". Taking into account that it is impossible to know the errors in real data sets (impossible to go on the field, evolution of the field), it was necessary (work carried out by Charlotte Pelletier in 2017 whose source code uses Matlab paid software) to first generate simulated data that allows to parameterize and adjust the level of labelling error. And thus to be able to measure the impact on the performance of the algorithms."
